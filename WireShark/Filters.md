Wireshark Filter Cookbook

A collection of practical Wireshark filters for SOC, IR, and pentesting tasks. Each entry includes:

Filter Expression (copy/paste ready)

Use Case (when/why to use)

Example Action (how to apply in an investigation)

üîé Host & IP Based Filters

Filter by specific IP (src or dst):

ip.addr == 192.168.1.10


Use Case: Focus only on one host.
Example: Investigate suspected compromised workstation.

Filter by source only:

ip.src == 192.168.1.10


Example: Look at what traffic a host is generating.

Filter by destination only:

ip.dst == 192.168.1.10


Example: See inbound connections to a server.

Exclude internal IP range:

!(ip.addr == 192.168.0.0/16)


Example: Focus on external communication only.

üåê Protocol Filters

HTTP traffic only:

http


Example: Inspect web traffic for suspicious requests.

HTTPS traffic:

tcp.port == 443


Example: Identify encrypted sessions (good for checking volume, not contents).

DNS traffic:

dns


Example: Investigate potential DNS tunneling or exfiltration.

FTP traffic:

ftp || ftp-data


Example: Catch plaintext file transfers.

SMB / Windows file sharing:

smb || smb2


Example: Look for lateral movement or file access.

üîê Threat Hunting Filters

Detect potential beaconing (same interval connections):

ip.addr == <target IP> && tcp


Then: Sort by time ‚Üí look for repeating intervals.

Suspicious DNS queries (rare TLDs):

dns.qry.name contains ".xyz"


Example: Catch C2 using weird domains.

Cleartext credentials (HTTP POST logins):

http.request.method == "POST"


Example: Spot credential leaks in HTTP.

Suspicious RDP traffic (Brute force or external use):

tcp.port == 3389


Example: Check if RDP is being abused.

ICMP tunneling or ping sweeps:

icmp


Example: Look for abnormal ICMP payloads.

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Filters

TCP retransmissions & errors:

tcp.analysis.retransmission


Example: Spot unstable connections.

Packets with no response (possible dropped traffic):

tcp.analysis.lost_segment


Example: Find network issues or firewall drops.

TLS handshake failures:

ssl.handshake.failure


Example: Debug broken HTTPS sessions.

‚ö° Quick Actions

Use Ctrl+F ‚Üí String to search inside packet contents (e.g., for ‚Äúpassword‚Äù).

Use Statistics ‚Üí Conversations to pivot by IP, port, or protocol.

Export suspicious objects via File ‚Üí Export Objects (HTTP/SMB/DICOM).
