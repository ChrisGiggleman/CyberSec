🛡️ Pentesting Lab Section (Day #14 → onward)
Lab Categories

We can break the pentest labs into categories, each covering recon, scanning, exploitation, and post-exploitation:

Recon & Enumeration

🔍 Subdomain & DNS enumeration

🔍 Service & port scanning (Nmap, your portscan tool)

🔍 Banner grabbing & OS fingerprinting

Vulnerability Scanning

🛠️ Nikto (web vuln scanner)

🛠️ Nmap NSE scripts

🛠️ Your custom webscan tool

Exploitation Basics

⚔️ SQL Injection (DVWA or bWAPP)

⚔️ Brute force attacks (Hydra, Medusa)

⚔️ File upload exploitation

Post-Exploitation / Persistence

🗝️ Reverse shells

🗝️ Privilege escalation (Linux/Windows basics)

🗝️ Maintaining access (cron jobs, services)

Reporting & Defense Awareness

📋 Documenting findings

📋 How blue teams would detect each attack (SIEM tie-in)

Example Starting Point

Let’s make Day #14: Nmap & Enumeration Basics

🎯 Objective: Learn how to use Nmap for reconnaissance and enumeration during a penetration test.
🛠️ Lab Setup:

Attacker: Kali Linux VM

Target: Metasploitable2 or DVWA (running on another VM)

🧪 Step-by-Step Investigation:

Discover live hosts

nmap -sn 192.168.56.0/24


→ Identifies targets in your lab subnet.

Perform a basic port scan

nmap -sS -p 1-1000 192.168.56.101


→ SYN scan of common ports.

Service & version detection

nmap -sV 192.168.56.101


→ Detects what services and versions are running.

OS fingerprinting

nmap -O 192.168.56.101


Output results for reporting

nmap -A 192.168.56.101 -oN nmap_results.txt


✅ Expected Outcome: Students will see open ports like FTP (21), SSH (22), HTTP (80), MySQL (3306), etc. on Metasploitable2 and learn how to document them.
