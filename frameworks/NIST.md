# 🏛️ NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) – Quick Reference

The **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** provides a **risk-based, flexible approach** to improving cybersecurity.  
It is structured around **five core functions**, each broken into categories and subcategories.

## 📊 The Five Functions

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Identify (ID)** | Understand the organization’s environment, assets, risks, and supply chain. |
| **Protect (PR)** | Safeguard assets through controls, access, training, and protective tech. |
| **Detect (DE)** | Identify anomalies and potential incidents quickly. |
| **Respond (RS)** | Take action when an incident occurs to contain and mitigate. |
| **Recover (RC)** | Restore systems, data, and capabilities after an incident. |

## 🔐 Categories & Subcategories (High-Level)

### 🟦 Identify (ID)
- **ID.AM – Asset Management**: Hardware, software, and data are inventoried.  
- **ID.RA – Risk Assessment**: Risk management processes are established.  
- **ID.SC – Supply Chain Risk Management**: Third-party/vendor risks are addressed.  

### 🟩 Protect (PR)
- **PR.AC – Access Control**: User identity, least privilege, MFA.  
- **PR.AT – Awareness and Training**: Cybersecurity training programs.  
- **PR.DS – Data Security**: Protect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  
- **PR.IP – Protective Technology**: Secure configs, patching, and protective measures.  

### 🟨 Detect (DE)
- **DE.CM – Security Continuous Monitoring**: Monitor networks, logs, systems.  
- **DE.DP – Detection Processes**: Incident detection is standardized and repeatable.  

### 🟥 Respond (RS)
- **RS.RP – Response Planning**: Incident response plans in place and tested.  
- **RS.CO – Communications**: Coordination during incident handling.  
- **RS.AN – Analysis**: Impact and scope of incident determined.  
- **RS.IM – Mitigation**: Contain and mitigate impact.  

### 🟪 Recover (RC)
- **RC.RP – Recovery Planning**: Tested recovery plans for systems/data.  
- **RC.IM – Improvements**: Lessons learned incorporated post-incident.  
- **RC.CO – Communications**: Communicate recovery status to stakeholders.
