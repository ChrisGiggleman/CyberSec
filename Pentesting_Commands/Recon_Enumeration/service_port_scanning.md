# üîç Service & Port Scanning

Service and port scanning is a core step in **network reconnaissance**. It allows security analysts to identify open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities on a target system. Tools like **Nmap** and custom scanning scripts are widely used for this purpose.

## üìå Why Service & Port Scanning?
- Detects open ports (entry points).
- Identifies running services (HTTP, SSH, SMB, etc.).
- Determines service versions (used for vulnerability matching).
- Helps in baseline mapping of a network.
- Provides insights for penetration testing or defense hardening.

## ‚ö° Commonly Used Tools
### 1. **Nmap**
- Industry-standard port scanner.
- Supports:
  - TCP/UDP scans.
  - OS fingerprinting.
  - Service detection.
  - Scriptable scans (NSE).
- Example Commands:
  ```bash
  # Scan top 1000 TCP ports
  nmap target.com
  
  # Scan all ports
  nmap -p- target.com
  
  # Detect service versions
  nmap -sV target.com
  
  # Aggressive scan (OS, version, script, traceroute)
  nmap -A target.com
  
  # Save results
  nmap -sV -oN results.txt target.com
2. Custom Portscan Tool
Lightweight Python-based scanner.

Benefits:

Customizable timeout and retries.

Can log results to CSV or JSON.

Includes banner grabbing.

Example Usage:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Scan host with port range
portscan 192.168.1.10 -p 20-1000

# Save results to CSV
portscan example.com -p 1-65535 -o results.csv

üîë Key Scanning Techniques
TCP Connect Scan (-sT): Full TCP handshake, reliable but noisy.

SYN Scan (-sS): Half-open scan, stealthier, requires root/admin.

UDP Scan (-sU): Identifies UDP services, slower.

Service Version Detection (-sV): Extracts banners and version info.

Aggressive Scan (-A): Combines OS detection, version, scripts, traceroute.

üìù Best Practices
Always scan in a controlled lab or with permission.

Start with a fast scan (top 1000 ports), then move to full range.

Log and compare results for baseline monitoring.

Use service detection to identify weak/vulnerable services.

Automate scanning for continuous monitoring.
