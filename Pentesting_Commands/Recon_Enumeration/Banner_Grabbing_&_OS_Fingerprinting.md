🕵️‍♂️ Banner Grabbing & OS Fingerprinting
🎯 Objective

Banner grabbing and OS fingerprinting are reconnaissance techniques used to identify services, applications, and operating systems running on a target system. This information is essential for vulnerability assessment, exploitation planning, and understanding the attack surface.

📌 What is Banner Grabbing?

Definition: Collecting information that services expose when you connect to them (like version numbers, software names, etc.).

Purpose:

Identify running applications.

Detect outdated or vulnerable software.

Gain insight into the target’s environment.

🔧 Common Tools & Methods

Netcat (nc)

nc <target_ip> 80


Type HEAD / HTTP/1.0 and press Enter twice to grab the HTTP banner.

Telnet

telnet <target_ip> 21


Useful for connecting to services like FTP or SMTP.

cURL

curl -I http://<target_ip>


Retrieves HTTP response headers.

Nmap (with NSE scripts)

nmap -sV --script=banner <target_ip>


Performs banner grabbing with service detection.

📌 What is OS Fingerprinting?

Definition: The process of identifying a target’s operating system using network characteristics and responses.

Purpose:

Helps narrow down exploits that apply to specific OS versions.

Provides insights into the system architecture.

🔧 Techniques

Passive OS Fingerprinting

Observes normal network traffic (TTL, TCP options, window size).

Tools: Wireshark, p0f.

Active OS Fingerprinting

Sends crafted packets and analyzes responses.

Tools: Nmap, Xprobe2.

🔧 Nmap for OS Detection
# Basic OS detection
nmap -O <target_ip>

# Aggressive scan (OS detection + service versions + scripts + traceroute)
nmap -A <target_ip>

⚠️ Limitations & Countermeasures

Limitations

Firewalls and IDS can block probes.

Banner information may be falsified (banner obfuscation).

OS detection may not always be accurate.

Countermeasures

Disable unnecessary banners.

Use port knocking or firewalls.

Employ intrusion detection/prevention systems.

Regularly patch services to avoid fingerprint-based exploits.
