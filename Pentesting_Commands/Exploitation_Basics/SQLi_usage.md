# ⚔️ SQL Injection – Explanation & Usage

---

## 🔹 What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection (SQLi) is a web application vulnerability where user input is improperly sanitized, allowing attackers to run arbitrary SQL queries.  
This can lead to authentication bypass, data exfiltration, or even full system compromise.

---

## 🔹 When to Use

- Login forms
- Search boxes
- URL parameters (`?id=1`)
- API requests

---

## 🔹 Types of SQL Injection

1. **Union-based SQLi** – Extract data by combining results with `UNION SELECT`.  
2. **Error-based SQLi** – Trigger DB error messages to reveal information.  
3. **Boolean Blind SQLi** – Infer results by observing true/false conditions.  
4. **Time-based Blind SQLi** – Use delays (`SLEEP()`) to infer results.

## 🔹 Lab Example (DVWA)

1. Navigate to DVWA → *SQL Injection* module.  
2. Test input with:  
   ```sql
   ' OR '1'='1 --
✅ Should bypass authentication.
3. Automate with sqlmap:

bash
Copy code
sqlmap -u "http://dvwa.local/vulnerable.php?id=1" --dbs
🔹 Mitigation (Blue Team Awareness)
Use parameterized queries / prepared statements.
