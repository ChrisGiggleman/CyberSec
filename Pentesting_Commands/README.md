## 🔓 Pentesting Section

This section of the Cybersecurity Lab Guide introduces penetration testing concepts, tools, and labs.  
It is designed to help you safely practice offensive security skills in a controlled environment.

### 📌 Labs

#### 1. **Web Vulnerability Scanner (`webscan`)**
- 🔍 Scan web applications for common vulnerabilities.
- ✅ Detects:
  - SQL Injection
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
  - Directory Traversal
- 🛠 Example:
  ```bash
  python3 webscan.py -u http://targetsite.com
---
### 2. Credential Sprayer / Brute Forcer (credspray)
🔑 Test login portals with username/password combinations.

⚠️ For lab environments only — do not use on unauthorized systems.

🛠 Example:
python3 credspray.py -u users.txt -p passwords.txt -t http://targetsite.com/login
----
### 3. Wi-Fi Sniffer / Monitor (wifiscan)
📡 Capture wireless packets and monitor nearby Wi-Fi networks.

Useful for learning WPA2 handshakes.

🛠 Example:
sudo python3 wifiscan.py --iface wlan0
---
### 4. Reverse Shell Generator (shellforge)
💀 Generate payloads for remote access.

🛠 Example:
python3 shellforge.py -t python -l 10.0.0.5 -p 4444
---
### 5. Network Share Enumerator (sharescan)
📂 Scan networks for exposed SMB/NFS shares.

🛠 Example:
python3 sharescan.py -t 10.0.0.0/24
---
### 6. Phishing Email Generator (phishforge)
🎣 Build phishing email templates for awareness training.

🛠 Example:
python3 phishforge.py -t employee@company.com -s "Important Update"
---
### 7. Custom Exploit Launcher (xploitctl)
💣 Launch custom exploits in a controlled environment.

🛠 Example:
python3 xploitctl.py -m exploit_module -t 10.0.0.10
---
### 8. VulnDB Auto Checker (vulncheck)
📊 Cross-check system software against known vulnerabilities.

🛠 Example:
python3 vulncheck.py -s software_list.txt
---
### ⚠️ Disclaimer
All tools and labs in this section are for educational and authorized testing only.
Do not run these tools on networks, systems, or applications without explicit permission.

- **Section titles** (##, ###, ####)  
- **Bulleted lists**  
- **Code blocks** (inside triple backticks ```bash)  

Do you want me to also **add icons (like 🔓, 📡, 💀, etc.) for each tool** in your pentest section, or keep
