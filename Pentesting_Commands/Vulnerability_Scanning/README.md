# 🔐 Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weaknesses in systems, applications, and services.  
It helps detect outdated software, misconfigurations, and exposed services before attackers can exploit them.

## 📌 Tools Covered in This Section

- 🛠️ **Nikto** – Web vulnerability scanner for common misconfigurations, outdated software, and insecure files.

## ⚡ General Tips

- Always perform scans **ethically** and only on systems you have permission to test.  
- Combine multiple tools for better coverage (e.g., Nmap for ports + Nikto for web vulns).  
- Use output redirection (`-oN`, `--output`) to save results for later analysis.  
- Validate false positives by manual testing or cross-checking with other tools.
