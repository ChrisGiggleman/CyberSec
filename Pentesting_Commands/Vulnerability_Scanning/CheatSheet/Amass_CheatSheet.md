# 🌐 Amass Quick Reference

Amass is a powerful tool for in-depth DNS enumeration and attack surface mapping.

---

## 🔧 Installation
```bash
sudo apt install amass -y

# or use Go
go install -v github.com/owasp-amass/amass/v4/...@master
```
## 🖥️ Basic Usage
```bash
amass enum -d example.com
```
➡ Perform a basic passive enumeration of subdomains.

```bash
amass intel -d example.com
```
➡ Discover related domains and organizations.
---
⚡ Advanced Examples
```bash

amass enum -active -d example.com -o subdomains.txt
```
➡ Active enumeration with results saved to file.

```bash

amass enum -brute -d example.com -src -ip -dir amass_output
```
➡ Brute force subdomains, show source & IP, and save in a directory.

```bash

amass viz -d3 -dir amass_output
```
➡ Create a D3 graph visualization of results.

📌 Notes
Use -passive for stealth mode (OSINT only).

Use -active for in-depth scans (may generate traffic).

Combine Amass with Sublist3r or dnsenum for best results.
