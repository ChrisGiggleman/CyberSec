📖 Overview

Nmap (Network Mapper) is not only a powerful network scanner but also comes with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE).
NSE scripts extend Nmap’s functionality by automating common penetration testing and vulnerability assessment tasks.
Scripts are written in Lua and fall into categories such as:

Vulnerability detection (e.g., http-vuln-cve2006-3392)

Brute force attacks (e.g., ftp-brute, ssh-brute)

Information gathering (e.g., http-title, smb-os-discovery)

Malware detection (e.g., smtp-strangeport, irc-unrealircd-backdoor)

NSE allows analysts to go beyond simple port scanning by detecting misconfigurations, weak credentials, and known vulnerabilities.

⚡ Common Commands
Run All Default Scripts
nmap -sC <target>


(equivalent to --script=default)

Run Specific Script
nmap --script http-title <target>

Run Multiple Scripts
nmap --script "http-title,http-headers,http-server-header" <target>

Run Script Category
nmap --script vuln <target>


(runs all vulnerability detection scripts)

Script with Arguments
nmap --script http-brute --script-args http-brute.path=/admin <target>

Run Script Against a Port Range
nmap -p 80,443 --script http-enum <target>

Update Script Database
nmap --script-updatedb

🔄 Workflow Example
Scenario: Web Server Enumeration

Initial Service Scan

nmap -sV -p 80,443 <target>


→ Identifies web server and versions.

Run Enumeration Scripts

nmap -p 80,443 --script "http-title,http-enum,http-headers" <target>


→ Gathers metadata about web services.

Check for Vulnerabilities

nmap -p 80,443 --script vuln <target>


→ Detects known CVEs and misconfigurations.

Credential Testing

nmap -p 21,22 --script "ftp-brute,ssh-brute" <target>


→ Attempts weak login detection (use responsibly in a test lab).

🛡️ Best Practices

Always update scripts before use (--script-updatedb).

Use -T4 for faster scans but consider stealth with lower timing.

Avoid brute force scripts on production systems.

Run targeted scans (by port/service) to reduce noise.
